Getting the code:
    With git installed, clone the repository with:
    
    git clone git://github.com/substack/tsunami-online-mapping-system.git

Installation requirements:
    python-2.6
    
    pip # to install python packages
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
    
    sqlite3 # file-based database
        http://sqlite.org/
    
    python libs:
        # For each of these: sudo pip install $name
        itty # web microframework
        jinja2 # template engine
        sqlite3 # database library
        sqlalchemy # object relational mapper
        elixir # declarative layer for sqlalchemy

Running the service:
    To use as a standalone service:
        python frontend/bin/server.py
    By default, the server will bind to 0.0.0.0:8081, which can be changed near
    the top of server.py
    
    It's possible to tie together any wsgi app with apache, but this was not
    explored. More info at:
        http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/ 

Ingesting data:
    The ingest script at "frontend/bin/ingest.py" loads data from the old website
    into the new database. Specifically, deformations, grids, and markers are
    loaded from:
    
        http://burn.giseis.alaska.edu/deformations/
        http://burn.giseis.alaska.edu/grids/
        http://burn.giseis.alaska.edu/scripts/
    
    Executing this script repeatedly will update existing pieces
    of data but will not add duplicate entries. If a file disappears from the
    old website it will not be deleted from the new database.
    
    Separately, import the png overlay files into "frontend/overlays".
